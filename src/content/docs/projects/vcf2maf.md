# Backstory

> Thanks for this, everyone. I have merged recent PRs and made fixes related to changes in VEP args and output. See https://github.com/mskcc/vcf2maf/releases/tag/v1.6.22

> There is no team at MSKCC working on vcf2maf anymore, after I quit in 2020. But I still have edit rights to the repo. Let me go through all the forks and see which one is a worthwhile replacement. Then I'll update the readme to redirect folks there.
