If you're a mentor looking to donate your time to the next generation, this guide is for you!

Just click the "edit" button on any project that you think you could help someone navigate maintaining, and add your name, and GitHub username to the file.

Someone looking to learn by maintaining the project will come along and create a PR to start a discussion to see if they're a good fit for the project and your mentoring style.

Think this is a little ad-hoc? Have a better idea of how to structure it! Submit a PR!
