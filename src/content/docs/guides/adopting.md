title: Adopting a Project
description: How to find the right project for you
---

## How to get Started

1. Find a project that you're interested in
2. Fork the projects repo
3. Make a PR to the adopt-a-code page adding that you've adopted the project, adding a link to your fork.
4. If that project has a mentor, they'll comment back on the PR and discuss the project, goals and you all can decide if you're a good fit.
5. Enjoy your new project!

## First things to do

So you've just gotten your project home and you're wondering what to do with it.

- Some things might be to add a [CITATIONS file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files) to the repo.
- You might want to jot down some of the plans that you have. GitHub issues or a simple text file are great options.
- Try to get in touch with the original author.
- Get in touch with some current users. Maybe they have a mailing list or just have been using GitHub issues.
